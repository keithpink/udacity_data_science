To have a better understanding of programmer’s mental health, the project uses Stack Overflow’s developer survey data from 2021 to explore which are prevalent mental diseases among programmers, and what might be potential factors contributing to the disease.

## 2. [Disaster Response Pipeline](https://github.com/keithpink/udacity_data_science/tree/main/disaster_response_pipeline_project)<a name="project2"></a>

The purpose of the project is to analyze disaster data from [Appen](https://appen.com/) (formally Figure 8) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

The project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

## 3. [Recommendations with IBM](https://github.com/keithpink/udacity_data_science/tree/main/recommendations_with_IBM)<a name="project3"></a>

This project will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles. The scrrenshot above is an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Platform.
